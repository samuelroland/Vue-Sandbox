/**
 *  Project: DevDashboard

 */

 Ideas to implement:
 - Stats on a given string (how many chars, the string with a limit of chars applied, search a substring and get occurrences,
 - Fetch first paragraph of a wikipedia page to get a quick definition of a word (propose different solutions if not found directly)
 - Fetch DeepL website to get the translations of a word in french translated to english
 - Fetch HackerNews API on hn.algolia.com/ like https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=markdown to find the last article that get more than x points and that are related to at least of subject of a list
 - Fetch Github API for given repos (repos that your have starred for ex.) to get the last created issues with labels "good first issue"
 - Fetch PHP, VueJS, Laravel, (or others languages) official documentation, search a function, class, ... display personal notes in MD from a file.
