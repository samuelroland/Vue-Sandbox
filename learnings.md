## What do I have learned ?

- component basic creation
- v-if
- v-model
- v-for
- {{ message }} = value in the DOM binded with a property
- v-bind:<attribute> = like {{ x }}, but for a html attribute binding
- v-on:<eventname> = start a method or execute code when event happens
- v-once = binging only once (then binding is ignored)
- v-html = interpolate raw html (binding ignored!)
